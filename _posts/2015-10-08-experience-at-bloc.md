title: My Experience at Bloc
---

I started my journed at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io) in March 2015. With no prior programming experience, I was overwhelmed and hesitant when it came time to choosing a bootcamp. I worked full-time, so at the time I couldn't attend an immersive course. 

I narrowed it down to three options, and talked to their advisors over the phone. When I spoke with Andy @ Bloc, he was easy to talk to. He listened first to what my concerns, questions and comments were, then he proceeded to talk about the course. He explained in detail how things worked, and said to reach out to him if I had any more questions. 

The fact that I would have a mentor with whom I could work 1-on-1 was very appealing. Once I started the course, this proved to be a fantastic approach at learning how to code. Always having someone to turn to when you need help is amazing. 

I started off with Levi as my mentor, he was crucial in me learning the basics and foundation of Rails Web Development. Since he is a full-time employee at Bloc, a few changes were made and my mentor became Matt, who continued Levi's good work. 

The mentor change seemed a bit rough at first, I was used to Levi's approach. Nevertheless, I'm glad that things worked out this way because I was able to learn to adapt to somebody else's workflow. I believe this will be useful once I'm working with other people on the same project.
