title: FrontEnd Web Dev GOALS!
---
### WHY, Did I Decide To Become a Web Developer?
Thats a very easy question to answer. Since my early days I've always wanted to dabble with computers and technology in some sort of ways. I started with computer hardware at the beginning but that is kind of a dead end career no one wants to know how the inside of a computer works only how to connect to the web and use web apps like facebook or email.

That brings me to my decision to start my jouney into becoming a web developer. With deciding to learn web dev I could build the sites and the apps that people wanted to use and access. Since my early days I always wanted to create content but I wasn't always the most artistic person, so drawing was out of the question. That points me to creating content online where with the click of a button from typing out code I could create content without putting my drawing skills on display lol.

Over the years I've enjoyed watching the evolution of the world wide web from the early AOL days with dial-up connection to now everyone having fast speed internet connection from their cable providers. From gaming with your neighborhood buddies to now having access to gaming with people from all over the world! That's just insane to think of over 2 decades ago. I guess you can say my joy of using the internet and what it can accomplish for our lives is what drove me to wanting to become a web developer.

My main goals for wanting to become a web developer our:
<ul>
    <li>Create & Share content online</li>
    <li>Have freedom to work remotely</li>
    <li>Develop web apps & websites for businesses</li>
    <li>Create websites for my hobbies</li>
    <li>Start on online bussiness one day</li>
</ul>

### Create and Share content online:
Coming from a gaming background when I was younger I was one of those kids who tried to make websites using a domain name and creating content for clans. I guess you can say that's where I really got my start with web development even though they weren't the best looking sites I got to dabble with creating content at an early age. I want to use that same passion and help create templates and structures that other people would like to use one day.

### Having the freedom to work remotely
It's time to make a dream become a reality, who doesn't want to have that freedom of working from their home or local coffee house!?! It's always been my vision mine that I could go to sleep when the sun goes down and wake up when the sun rises. Eat my favorite breakfast(eggs,bacon,toast w/ peanut butter and hashbrowns) then plan my day hit the gym and get my work day started. Unfortunately due to reality I can't do that yet, but I see web development as a stepping stone to help get me into that **DIRECTION!**

### Developing web apps & websites for businesses
The best way to master your technique is to continue to learn and grow and what a better way to do that then to share it with others!(work with others too!) Like I mentioned before I want to create something that will be beneficial to others so maybe someone else can be inspired like I was from an early age and they too can create something that will help out the next generation and so on and so on like an inifinite loop lol!

### Create websites for my Hobbies
This one is a no brainer with great powers come great resposibility although that being the tools to manipulate web pages to broadcast what your interests are. I look at this as more of a side project I will be doing to help perfect my craft and also share with those who are also interest in the same hobbies as me like health, fitness sports and cooking.

### Start on online business
With all these great tools at my disposal the last step for me is to start an online business and become an entrepreneur for myself. It will be amazing learning from others then finally putting together all the tools for myself to really be successful one day.

### Final Thoughts!?!
That pretty much sums up why I chose such an extraordinary field to pursue. If you share these similar interests tag along with me so you may also be inspired to do the same or you can spread the word to a friend looking for there life purpose!
