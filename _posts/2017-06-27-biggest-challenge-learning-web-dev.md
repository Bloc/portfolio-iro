title: My Biggest Challenge Learning Web Dev so far...
---
### <center>My First Web Language</center>
Web Dev what can I say? It's not easy and it sure isn't fun when you don't have a clue to what you're doing. But stick with me now it does get a whole lot of fun and interesting when you breakthrough pass learning your first language. For me it was JavaScript, JS works wonders throughout the web and is one of the most common used langauge on the internet. Here's a quick summary of my up's and down's with <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript">JavaScript</a>(Where I Learned JS!).

### <center>JavaScript!</center>
Like I mentioned above JavaScript(JS) was the first language I learned when I was starting my jouney on becoming a Web Developer. It started out easy and with the lessons provided from <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript">www.codeschool.com</a> through my coding bootcamp <a href="https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-bootcamp?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=sem&utm_campaign=adwords_brand&utm_adgroup=adwords_brand__bloc_terms&utm_keyword=adwords_brand__bloc_terms__bloc.io&gclid=Cj0KEQjw4cLKBRCZmNTvyovvj-4BEiQAl_sgQhWXoQ8D86cPj0528GBwL7agSi7ruwc9GquKKc0iTxYaAtkH8P8HAQ">**BLOC**</a>, I was introduced to JS in minutes. You know a couple quick tutorials containing things like this:

{% highlight js %}
var ten = 10;

var addFive = ten + 5;

console.log(addFive); //15
{% endhighlight %}
Simple Right? ...turned into This:

{% highlight js %}
function distinct(a) {
  var results = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] !== a[i+1]) {
      results.push(a[i]);
    }
  }
  return results;
}

distinct([1,1,2,3,4,5,5,5,6,7,7]);
//returns [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
//function I built to remove duplicate numbers in an array
{% endhighlight %}

### <center>Houston we have problem!</center>
My biggest issue was building functions to generate web content and building functions on top of functions to create a bigger function then calling that function(that's a lot huh?, but that's how they work <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">*here's a basic function*</a>)! Even with all the lessons and help with my mentor I felt like I wasn't grasping the knowledge down yet. Yes, I was using them to build a project called **Bloc Jams**(in my projects section), but I really wasn't building them on my own until... <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars!!!</a> Yes, you're reading that correctly(sounds a little dramatic to me) a site made for you to practice coding building functions with the language of your choice!

This helped me out a lot with my function building problem and I am no means an expert at it yet. But It's helped me to gain more confidence when I make them and breathe a little easier when I tackle on crafting complicated functions. I still practice there till this day and try to build one function in the morning and another one before bed. I must warn you though since it is practice they have very easy ones and extremely hard ones, but you get to choose which one you would like to do!

### <center>JavaScript still a Challenge!</center>
Building JS functions are still a problem for me til this day, but I've learned to cope with it and work them out step by step with a little method called `plain english`. What does that mean? Well it's just building a function by writing out the steps you need to take before you start to code. Once you figure that out you just need to translate your words into code sort of like translating english to another language. Then when I know what I need I can rely on my JS skills to translate or simply do a google search(it really needs to be in depth!) to fill in the blanks of what I need. It doesn't always work but I do have a mentor while I'm on this journey and he has helped me out tremendously, so that's my biggest challenge so far but it hasn't stopped me from **CODING!!!!!**
