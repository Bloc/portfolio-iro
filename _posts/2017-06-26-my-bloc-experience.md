title: My Experience At BLOC

From starting at my local community college trying to learn computer science, all the way to **BLOC**(a fast paced online coding bootcamp)! My journey has been long and the road has been bumpy but I still find a way to keep my web dev dreams alive through the great resources that BLOC offers. From online mentors to help you when your stuck and to great courses that teach you how to code and build projects along your journey. From not knowing a lick about how javascript works to learning how the use AngularJS frameworks and applying it to future projects. Here's how my experience at BLOC has gone so far.

This is <a href="https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-bootcamp?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=sem&utm_campaign=adwords_brand&utm_adgroup=adwords_brand__bloc_terms&utm_keyword=adwords_brand__bloc_terms__bloc.io&gclid=Cj0KEQjw4cLKBRCZmNTvyovvj-4BEiQAl_sgQhWXoQ8D86cPj0528GBwL7agSi7ruwc9GquKKc0iTxYaAtkH8P8HAQ">**BLOC**</a> where I'm currently going through a coding bootcamp. Like I mentioned before I attended my local community college and decided that a computer science degree was the path I wanted to take. Boy was I wrong it turns out that devoting the first couple years to learning the hierarchies of math just wasn't something I was into. Add that a long with some unexpected life events and a withdrawal from my school was necessary <i class="em em-disappointed"></i>. Insert in **BLOC** a few years later and I'm back in the hunt to learn web development <i class="em em-smiley"></i>.  With **BLOC** I found that I can pursue my goal faster and get practice into what I really wanted to do with their amazing courses that provide the tools I need to learn the Full Stack Web Development!

This was no walk in the park however, the times were getting tough and I had yet to fully commit to the program like you're required to. I remember feeling like giving up because it was too fast paced for me and I wasn't retaining the information like I thought I would be. Then suddenly came a turn around in my thought process. I said you know what if I'm going to be spending my time and money on this program I might as well give it my full effort night <i class="em em-moon"></i> and day <i class="em em-sunny"></i>! When I say full effort I mean no more going out to parties and drinking because I need my mind clear and devoided of hangovers at all cost(I wanted to be refreshed each day I woke up to code). No more eating junk food for the most part because I read it could cause you to not think at your best. That is another thing that learning to code has taught me, how to read more books on becoming a better person in all aspects of life. Yes, that means a lot of self help books but you'd be amazed at the information you get from books <i class="em em-books"></i> instead of reading online bologne.

Now that I've fully committed to the BLOC program I feel like I'm less stressed when I'm trying to learn all this information. What can I say yes, it will still be stressful because their is a lot of reading involved when your trying to learn the complex language of the web. But when you start to grasp the knowledge little by little like I did you will be reading code in no time and finding that when you're actually reading code you are reading it in code! eg. 
{% highlight js %}
function count(n) {
 n = 10;
  for(var i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
   i++
  }
 return n;
}
{% endhighlight %}
I would read it like this: function count is passing n. n equals 10 and i equals 0 so if i is less than 10 keep counting up if i is less than or equal to 10.
I know this may seem a little basic but compared to how I was a few months ago I would say what the heck is this thing!?!

I'm still learning at BLOC and with my new found hope I can say I'm enjoying it more than day 1 and I'm already a couple months in. Although I did fall behind I'm not discouraged by it and I have a mentor that encourages me to keep pushing on as well. I would say if you would like to code at BLOC as well you should check out there website here once again <a href="https://www.bloc.io/web-developer-career-bootcamp?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=sem&utm_campaign=adwords_brand&utm_adgroup=adwords_brand__bloc_terms&utm_keyword=adwords_brand__bloc_terms__bloc.io&gclid=Cj0KEQjw4cLKBRCZmNTvyovvj-4BEiQAl_sgQhWXoQ8D86cPj0528GBwL7agSi7ruwc9GquKKc0iTxYaAtkH8P8HAQ">**BLOC**</a> read through all the documents they provide you with, this will help you prepare for **BLOC**(a little more than I was but that was my mistake) or if you want a more in depth detail to what to actually expect just send me an email and I will be happy to point you into the right direction to start you Web Development Career! <i class="em em-smiley"></i><i class="em em-smiley"></i><i class="em em-smiley"></i>
