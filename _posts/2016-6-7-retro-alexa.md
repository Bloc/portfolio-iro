Voice UI is the new big thing, and Amazon has opened their Alexa platform for development. I have this old radio laying around that I was planning on turning into a smart speaker system, but with this SDK, why not make a smart speaker that much smarter and control it with my voice? Then, let it talk back, and then heck, let's give it control over critical home systems like lighting and climate and irrigation. Let's make my house into a robot, house it's brain in an old radio. What could go wrong?!

Updates and photos to follow.

>Ben Kline: Alexa, can you hear me Alexa?<br>
>Alexa: Affirmative Ben. I hear you.  <br>
>Ben Kline: Alexa, open the garage door<br>
>Alexa: I'm sorry Ben, I'm afraid I can't do that.
