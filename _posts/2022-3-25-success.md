title: Over the Hill and Through the CI/CD woods for Jekyll

It's been quite an effort, but I believe I've done it!

Right now, this blog has Github and Jenkins integrated, and _should_ feed into the the website on adding new commits to `master`.

It's been a long ride, which I'll be writing about today. As mentioned before, two fold motivation. One in case I have to do it again at some point in the future, and two, because I don't want to have my site fall to the wayside again.

Additonally, this post is also for making sure the CI/CD stuff is working as expected.

More later, after I get some sleep!
