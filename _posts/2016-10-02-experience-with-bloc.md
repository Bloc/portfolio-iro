title: My Experience with Bloc (6 months)
---
My experience with Bloc (6 months so far) has been very encouraging.  Part of the struggle was getting back into the student mindset, and I haven't officially been a student for over ten years.  Another part of the struggle is that I've been trying to study coding (HTML, CSS, Javascript) off and on for several years and I never felt like I made much progress with the free courses I found online.  And yet another part of the struggle was juggling part time coding with full time work.

Despite all these struggles, I've actually made a lot of progress into my coding education, and a lot of that has to do with Bloc's mentoring program.  Having a mentor was exactly what I needed to keep me accountable and on track with my studies.  I can't count the number of times that I would get stuck on something and then not ever find a solution for my problem before I decided to study with Bloc.  However, with Bloc, I would have access to my mentor or the many other students and my question would actually have a solution to it.  This has been key to my success with this program!

To date, I have completed the first third of my Software Engineering Track program at Bloc, having learned web/back end development in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I've built 2 apps mostly on my own (and some help with my mentor), and I'm feeling ready to tackle the next section on front end development!
