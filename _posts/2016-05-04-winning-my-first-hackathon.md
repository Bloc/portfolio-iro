title: Winning My First Hackathon -- For Space!

A few weeks ago I was at a Women Who Code event in NYC. There they encouraged us to take advantage of Hackathons as they are great learning experiences. I was still at the meetup when I started researching others in NYC. I came across the NASA Space Apps Challenge and Science Hack Day 2016 in Brooklyn and immediately signed up. I am a HUGE space nerd and I am proud of it.

A few weeks later, it was time to go to the Friday night mixer which helps you to find a team, but I hesitated in attending. I thought, “I’m a beginner, what am I going to be able to build for NASA??” I’m sure glad I went.

Friday night there weren’t many people there. They allowed anyone that had an idea for a project to pitch it in front of the group. After the idea pitches we would all have pizza and beer and decide if we wanted to be on that person’s team .One of the projects pitched was by an origami artist. He didn’t really know exactly what he wanted to do, but he wanted it to involve origami because it was a category in the competition and it was his speciality. I was amazed by his sample designs and immediately knew I wanted to be on his team.

The next day we got up super early and met at CartoDB in Brooklyn who graciously hosted us for the weekend and immediately got to work. Three others joined our team, which we named, The Stellar Folds, and we all started jotting down ideas on a white board. The one that stuck the most was the idea of a self propelling origami robot. And just like that, we had our project. The new task was to find a problem for these robots to solve and where exactly they would be deployed. Oh, and how exactly they’d be self propelling.

We settled on the idea of deploying them on Mars, and named them Tumbleweeds. I was in charge of Mars data and info as I have a plethora of random Mars knowledge. I told them that there are high winds on Mars and BAM!, the self propelling part would be powered by the wind on Mars. We needed something that could roll in the wind. Our origami artist skillfully folded a working robot in two hours! Our first working prototype (second actual prototype) was a success! http://thestellerfoldsspaceorigami.tumblr.com/post/143281709427/here-is-our-second-prototype-the-magic-ball

We wanted something bigger and a little more round. We came up with the folding pattern and got to work. A few hours later, our next prototype was born.. http://thestellerfoldsspaceorigami.tumblr.com/post/143290281124/tumbleweed-2-in-action

With the design down, we needed to figure out what problem we were going to solve. I found out that there are about fourteen rovers on Mars right now, and of those only two are active. In many cases we don’t know what caused the rovers to shut down but it is speculated that they got too far from their base or that their solar panels were covered in dust and it could no longer charge. The idea of a mesh network was born. If these little robots could be deployed all over the planet they could each serve as a node in the network. This would allow the rovers to explore all of the planet rather than just the area that their base network covered.

Next, we decided that we wanted our Tumbleweeds to have electronics in them. We created a Wireless Orientation Module http://thestellerfoldsspaceorigami.tumblr.com/post/143326458461/soldering-our-wireless-orientation-module that we placed inside the Tumbleweed. We also decided we wanted to have GPS technology inside it so that it could map the terrain and location it is in. Lastly we wanted some sort of technology to record the weather patterns on Mars. This could serve as a warning system to other rovers if a bad dust storm is approaching.

Needless to say our project came together beautifully and we actually won our local competition. This means that The Stellar Folds are moving on to global judging by NASA executives! We are very excited and have continued to work on the project since the competition. We are working on having it 3-D printed to get a better idea of what the real robot would look like.

This NASA Hackathon was probably the most fun I’ve had in awhile. I got to use my technical knowledge as well as my knowledge of space and Mars. I am glad I ended up going instead of staying home. I will keep you updated on our project and the competition!
