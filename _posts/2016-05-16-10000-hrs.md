The process of learning new things sometimes sucks. Sure sometimes it's easy, and it's great when it is. However when new ideas and concepts
don't immediately become crystal clear, it's all too easy to get down about the situation.

When that happens to me, I remind myself of the 10,000 hour rule. The rule that it typically takes you around 10,000 
hours to master something. When I think about it that way, the 1-48 hours that I've been stuck on learning something doesn't 
seem quite so bad.

Until we can just hook our brains up to instantly download information like in the Matrix, I'll have to continue learning the 
old fashioned way...bit by bit.
