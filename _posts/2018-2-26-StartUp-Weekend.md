title: Start-Up Weekend!
---

  Over the weekend I decided to try something new and give Startup Weekend a shot.  I had never been to, or heard of, a Startup Weekend and I had never been to Fort Collins. Great! Two birds with one stone! After a full nights sleep I am really happy that I gave it a shot. I did zero coding the whole weekend (not what I expected), but learned quite a bit. I worked on a team of five people to create a business plan to start a hemp based concrete business. Never heard of it but it sounded cool. The team was comprised of three engineers, a UX/graphic designer, and me. Although I didn't get to do any coding, I learned so much about what it takes to validate a business idea. I did customer validation, market research, product research, presentation creation, and a lot of coffee chugging! My biggest challenge was getting into a business mindset and working with a team for every waking hour of a weekend. In the end, new skills were learned, nobody hated each other (in fact, friends were made!), and I now have a new passion for startups. Can't wait for the next one!
