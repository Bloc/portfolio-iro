Work Harder!
 

I worked for hours and hours on a project. Checked it again and again. My confidence was shaken. I starting questioning my abilities. Starting questioning others. Only to find another set of eyes point out that ATRIBUTE is spelled ATTRIBUTE. It’s the journey. 

For the last fifteen years, Las Vegas has been my residency. Working in the hospitality industry. I have worked for two exclusive properties. Both properties provided golf facilities to very high end clientele. Me! I was a golf caddie. Now, a caddie in Las Vegas at these two properties is unique. From the Forbes richest people list, well if they play golf I have probably caddied for them. Many have becomes friends and mentors.  I have caddied for three presidents. For men and women who run the countries largest companies. For billionaires. For one-timers. Economics to play on this property, could make a mortgage payment for most americas. A plethora celebrities. Most who were not very interesting. The individual who starting a business from an idea to taking it to a point where the company employees tens to thousands of people is a much more interesting story. 

Name dropping is not a professional etiquette.  

Yes golf has been part of my life. Things change. The game has changed. The clientele has changed. The property is changing. And I am changing. 

I probably need to explain what I did. My knowledge of the game was important, but it was way down the list of that I did. I have been a welcome ear to a great man whom just got news from his doctor that he had terminal cancer. He was told by the doctors to get personal affairs in order, because he only had a few months left. For eighteen holes spoke about how to break with news to his family. A month later he past. 



As SNL’s Chico Escuela once said, baseball been berry berry good. Well, Golf has been equally good. So, why the change. Why the pursuit of this new direction. Its really simple. Because I can.  

Before  golf I was in the manufacturing industry. Working in the tool and die business. Initially, programming CNC machining centers. All the way back with Fanuc programming. Then to AutoCad and Solidworks. I always enjoyed creating a physical “thing”. But the digital footprint of designing a virtual “thing” was a big part of it. 

I don’t entry this career change without some diligences, I have sought advise or mentoring from  a few very successful individuals within the software community. 

I chose bloc.io for two primarily reasons. First the flexible of the program to my schedule. and Secondly and maybe more important the mentorship relationship.  

I chose software development because every day I watch it change the world. I watched social media help elect two presidents. Watched change the faith of countries. Watched it change us as consumers. Watched it make the world smaller. It has create innovations most of us thought were impossible. I have watched software help friends find their spouse. 

There is some bad with the good. But its how one chooses to look at the world. I see good. 
I want to be a part of this. 

During my journey through bloc.io, I have found that mastering coding has many parallels to golf. It is forever changing and no one has mastered it. Work Harder.
