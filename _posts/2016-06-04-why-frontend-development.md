title: Why frontend development
---

My path to finally learning frontend development has been a longer one.

In the beginning accepted the benefits of using proprietary software from Microsoft and Adobe. These tools offered their own UX for a price. Each had its learning curve to be mastered whether you practiced at your own pace or a consultant taught you.

Their beauty was in their ability to handle complex challenges of long-form content; challenges like controlled vocabularies and thousands of pages (or word count equivalent). These are points that, however one extolls the beauty and dynamism of webpage design, haven't yet been solved in any satisfactory way by frontend technologies alone (at least the ones I've seen). For me, satisfactory means a writer can concentrate on the craft without piecing together a customized solution at high cost.

### Frontend development for technical communication

But we're slowly getting to the point where frontend technologies as we know them today will easily meet the challenges of long-form content.

As a technical communicator I'm obsessed by how readers will consume my content and am concerned whether it brings something or is useless. And let's face it, developing web applications can be a form of [technical communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_communication).

One thing that concerns me when using traditional help authoring tools is the downright lack of attractiveness and usability of the output. If you've seen help like this, then you know what I mean:

This is content in its own silo, hermetically sealed from the web. Maybe it's like this by design; a software package you can use offline. Maybe it's also offered on a beautifully crafted website (in this particular example I'm sure it is). But oftentimes, little thought is given to how users actually interact with user assistance, or even how to leverage information products for greater effect, like content marketing.

And because technical information is, after all, content, learning how to use frontend technologies for leveraging information is a valid endeavor. It will probably also make our customers happier.

### Frontend development is also fun

Frontend development has got to be one of the fastest evolving technical fields known. My Bloc mentor is a software developer and I asked how he keeps up with all the changes. Even though he recommended several newsletters, he admitted that it can be challenging.

With all the new, emerging variations of JavaScript alone, how can anyone fully understand enough to give professional advice on everything?

It's a young field and you're constantly learning something new, though you may be the most experienced person in the world. On the one hand, you have to be constantly active to learn new things. On the other, you're always challenged.

Of course there may be downsides, and I'm sure that maintenance projects to update all the code for new versions or technologies (especially while keeping backward compatibility) may not always be so exciting.

On balance though, web technologies will continue to positively impact all aspects of technical communication and I'd recommend learning frontend development to everyone designing user assistance.
