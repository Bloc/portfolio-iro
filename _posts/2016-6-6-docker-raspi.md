title: Docker + Rasberry-Pi = ???
---
>Pies are really just containers, delicious containers for delicious fillings.

There are [a lot](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=list%20of%20raspberry%20pi%20projects) of great uses for a Rasberry-Pi. Docker is a great method of sharing contained systems like these.

Wouldn't it be great to have a single website where people could browse through Docker images built specifically for the Rasberry-Pi or other system-on-a-chip boards like them, and even collaborate on them as well?  

A Github for Docker images of a very specific type.

Specifically, What brought me to this idea is that I want to create a family of A/V tools (VOIP and vidchat, plex servers and/clients, baluns to distribute AV over AVB, etc), that would all work on one kind of board, because then manufacturing would be really cheap, and it would be really easy to set each unit up for any specific job. The [Twillio API](https://www.twilio.com/) looks like a good place to start for the tools as well.

The Docker site would just make it that much easier to get these set up.

Are there any existing Github repos I should check out? Is there anything like this already? Comments!

If there aren't, and this is a genuinely good idea. Then, what is a good flavor of pie to name it after?
