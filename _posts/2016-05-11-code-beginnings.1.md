So looks like my journey down the rabbit hole has started. Taking the Red pill, 
plunging me from the surface world, into the world of one's, zero's, loops and arrays.

Working on code started for me with an HTML class in college where I coded a site for 
my band as my final project. Little did I know that would be the start of a long journey into learning 
that I am now finding out will never end.

After the band (and many others) disbanded, before gaining the level of success
that many never achieve. I learned that being in a band is like being one of 5 (or more) CEO's 
of a company. A lot gets discussed, and even less done, unless every single person
is committed, which rarely happens. Taking that knowledge, and seeing how much real life
drama happens during the creative process, I came up with an idea to start a social 
network to be a place to document that drama.

I came up with RealityFarm: a reality show based social network. It was a site that
people could upload their own user created reality show weekly where it could be 
rated and ranked alongside other user created shows.

My goal was to be the place where people could go to discover quality content in a 
weekly show based format.

The project was fully self-funded and I paid a developer to code the site. It was 
an expensive 4 years, and I decided that although the project didn't go to the level 
I would've liked it to get to, I wanted to continue my jouney into the coding universe.

I learned a lot from that project. Although I didn't code the site, I learned how to manage resources, 
work with a team of people, work on UI design, make technical decisions regarding 
the path to take, then deal with the consequences (good and bad) and how to network. 
These are all skills that I will take with me into my next project, job, career.

I can see how it's sometimes best to jump right into something. Looking back I
see that some of the decisions I made weren't correct, but that's life right?
