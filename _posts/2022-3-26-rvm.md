title: RVM for Jenkins
---

With setting up CI/CD, I wanted to make sure that I covered the actual steps I took instead of going off on a tangent. Though, much was learned when going off on said tangents.

I would be remiss if I didn't write about RVM.

The impetus of deploying my site was to integrate CI/CD, and I use Jekyll to generate static webpages which will then in turn _be_ the website when hosted. Simple, I thought.

However, going back to my `ruby` days, one of the things that I hated was the way that I may have been developing on a "up to date" ruby/rails setup, however, Jekyll dependencies may have fallen behind.

And in comes a well known version management system called [RVM](https://rvm.io).

The best way to install RVM on a system, is to follow the instructions. Since I'm using Debian on my webserver, installing as mentioned on the landing page is simple.

Additonally, I relied on the following to setup the `jenkins` user environment to properly call `rvm` found directly on their webpage [here](https://rvm.io/integration/jenkins). **Remember, you must run as the `jenkins` user**


```
su jenkins # need to log into jenkins as we _want_ jenkins to use rvm to build
gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
```

Additionally add the below lines into `~/.rvmrc` as the jenkins user:

```
rvm_install_on_use_flag=1
rvm_project_rvmrc=1
rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag=1
```

You can test by typing something like `type rvm | head -n 1` and you should get an output. I learned that you should see this output `type rvm | head -n 1` to have rvm work correctly on the `jenkins` user environment. 

That should be good enough to set your environment up in the meantime.

Continue as the `jenkins` user on your build machine. Now, we're going to be installing the ruby `gem`s that will install `jekyll` and `bundler`. `jekyll` is the ruby gem that is building the current webpage content for this website. `bundler` is a ruby "package" retriever that reads a file like `Gemfile`, and fetches packages that will allow the content you create on your source code, to be built into the static `html` content.

To pre-emptively fetch this software, you should run the following if you are based on a `Debian/Ubuntu` system.

```
# ads environment variables to the .bashrc
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# install gems
gem install jekyll bundler
```

That _should_ have you up and ready in terms of your build environment.
