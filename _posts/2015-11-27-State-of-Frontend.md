title: Is there really a finish line?
---

*Woo-hoo!* Once more week and I will finish the Bloc.io Frontend Web Development Course. What exactly does that mean? Can I start introducing myself as a developer?  

Technically, I created three whole websites/web applications with HTML, CSS, and javascript so I fit the dictionary definition. But when I read job postings there are a huge list of concepts, languages, and frameworks and no two job posting seem to require my exact set of skills. One of my biggest challenges is knowing have earned enough developer credit(expereince) to start calling myself a frontend developer? Do I keep looking or can I walk into a job interview and be like… “I bet I can figure it out it’s close to this other thing I know?”.

One of the ways I learn is listening to other people discuss ideas and issues in the technology community. (On another post I can share some of my favorite podcasts.) I especially like podcasts for when I have an issue like “what do other people in the tech community do about x” So I recently listened to a podcast that deals with my exact question as I end my Bloc experience. A List Apart is a great source of content for people who work in the the web and they have a couple of videos/google hangouts in a series including [“the State of Front-End Dev”](http://alistapart.com/event/front-end-dev). (Great timing for me on this topic.) This was a great video discussion which gave me a point of reference in order to get a better understanding about the meaning of front end dev title and a nudge to not get dissuaded by job posts vocabulary words. [spoiler: panelists stressed the importance of awareness of the syntax of the position over the details of a particular framework or language.]
Some of my favorite quotes that made me feel like I am gaining the right knowledge are:

>“A front end developer is just a problem solver who uses web technologies to solve problems”. 
- [Una Kravets](http://alistapart.com/event/front-end-dev) 

>“A title don’t matter as much as the decisions of what you do for work.” In reference to being a person with many years of experience doing the same thing over a person doing a variety of things for a shorter amount of time.
- [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net/)

> “The type of  person [who] is a good [frontend developer is someone who is] constantly learning” and [someone] who is okay with not knowing everything”... “The ability to know what questions to ask and be aware of what needs to be done is just as important.”
- [Rebecca Murphey](http://rmurphey.com/)

> “People who enable growth are very valuable. Leadership, direction, and mentoring are how I can me a multiplier.” In reference to sharing knowledge with the development community and/or your team at work is the true difference between a JR and a SR dev.
- [Marco Rogers](http://rmurphey.com/)

I really found this helpful and hopefully by sharing this I also strengthened my position as a multiplier (lol).
