title: Alexa Fact Skill Human Body Geek
---
I just launched another Alexa Skill for Amazon's [Echo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X4WHP5E?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=88444290302&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3415069854209575568&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_5bkerg09re_e_yac_yfmrw4). This time I used a fact skill template, specifically the [Space Geek](https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/spaceGeek) sample. I customized the sample to be a fact skill for the human body, hence Human Body Geek. This was another great exercise to learn more about the [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit), and Amazons developer console. I also learned how important it is to make sure sample utterances support the invocation phrases you set up. Additionally, its also necessary to recognize the difference between "Ask" and "Tell" invocations,specifically the askWithCard and tellWithCard functions.

The askWithCard function will keep a session going, while the tellWithCard functions session ends after the initial invocation is completed. For example, if I were to say, "Alexa, ask human body geek for a fact." The app would continue to remain open and I could potentially ask another utterance, "give me another human body fact." If I were to say, "Alexa, tell human body geek for a fact." Alexa would respond with one fact and then the session would end. To get another fact I would have to invoke Alexa to launch the app again. There is obviously a lot more that goes into this, but this is the basic idea, and one I learned the hard way.
