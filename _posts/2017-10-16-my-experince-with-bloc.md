title: My experience with Bloc
---
My experience with Bloc this far has been full of personal ups and downs. I would like to say I’m learning a lot everyday and everyday I retain 99% of the information and I’m really happy with my progress thus far but truth is Bloc is hard. 
Bloc takes up a lot of my off time and I’m not a good reader nor do I learn well by reading. I often find myself re reading how to do a JS task or googling around a concept that was introduced to me a week ago in hopes that I come across the perfect article that explains it in a way my brain understands. 
I do have to say the ciriculum of Bloc is great and the pace they keep you out is though but great, it forces me to do bloc at least every other day and give up weekends to catch up to lost concepts and assignments. I knew coming into Bloc would be tough but boy have I been right about that. 


I love what I’m learning it’s tough but it’s good and I would recommend Bloc to anyone who seriously want’s to learn front end development.
