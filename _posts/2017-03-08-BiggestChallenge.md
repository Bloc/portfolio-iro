title: The Biggest Challenge in Learning to Develop
---

I have been learning software development for 2 months. The biggest challenge in learning to develop is dealing with frustration. I know a little about this. For the last 20 years I have taught English to non-native speakers and studied a couple of other languages along the way. Learning a language requires patience and perseverance. It is a humbling struggle to become fluent knowing that you will make public mistakes.

And now I have decided to start all over again with software development. A couple of weeks ago I was working on a music player, BlocJams, in which we were learning to manipulate the DOM using vanilla JavaScript. Bloc does a good job of teaching the concepts, walking the student through implementation, and then challenging the student to come up with solutions on your own. In the earlier part of the course, this wasn't a problem. The challenges were simple and easy to solve. However, the DOM is not an easy concept to understand for a beginner, and trying to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in a complicated music player was a little overwhelming. Headbashing was in order. I understand the concept, but when it came to working through the code to select just the right element, I was lost. Parent-element? Child-element? I felt like an orphan.

Of course, this is part of the learning process, and my past experience offered a solution: take a break. After a short break, and the key is to keep it short and return to the struggle, I was able to see a solution. This is also where mentoring is a key part of the Bloc experience. When I discussed the problem with my mentor, I was able to understand the concept and why I had the problem. In a class, I don't think I could have gotten this personalized guidance.
