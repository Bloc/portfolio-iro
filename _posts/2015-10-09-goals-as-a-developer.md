title: My Goals as a Developer
---
I worked for a Chicago-based startup for over three (3) years. During that time, I worked closely with many different developers. Being able to witness first-hand the solutions they were able to craft, inspired me into starting a career as one of them. 

In synthesis, as a beginner, my current goals are:

* To find a group of people or company, where I can apply what I have learned during bootcamp 
* To polish my skills by starting new projects
* To expand my knowledge by reading more material and taking it to practice
* To learn and master the basics of Javascript, in addition to its many popular frameworks such as AngularJS and Ember.js

Ultimately, my main goal is to be able to garner enough knowledge to be able to help others create beautiful and efficient web applications.
