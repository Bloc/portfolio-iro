title: Running and Fog
---
I usually try and do some form of exercise everyday. With all of the latest studies out there it's no secret that exercise helps with productivity. It can even make you happier, smarter, and more energetic. All things I need as I take my daily dose of getting shot to the face with a fire hose full of *Ruby* and *Rails* information. Anyway, I was on a run early this morning and had an experience I thought I'd share.  

I live about ten minutes inland from Malibu, Ca. If you have ever lived on the Pacific Coast you will be familiar with the coastal fog that rolls inland in the evening and usually lingers until early morning. On my run this morning it was particularly foggy, and the ridge line I like to run I noticed I couldn't see anything in any direction, just what was in front of me. I immediately thought how similar my run was to how I have been feeling about my first month of this software engineering journey. Just like the foggy ridge line and no clear view in any direction but forward, so it has been with learning *Ruby* and *Rails*.

The connection between my run and programming I'm sure sounds a bit depressing. Let me lighten it up some for you. While it was super foggy, more than most mornings, it was still beautiful and satisfying. There were actually a few moments during my run that I actually saw through the fog and could see homes, or even neighboring ridge lines. My experience thus far with programming although very foggy is enjoyable, and satisfying, especially when you have those "ah ha" moments, or you actually see your application running on a browser. It's those moments where the fog is lifted and new understanding is gained.

I guess the conclusion to this analogy is that I expect this journey to be full of foggy moments. But, if I can just persevere and maintain a forward focus on the end goal those "ah ha" moments will keep coming. Usually, when we are faced with challenges and can't see the forest through the trees that is when we need to bare down, suck it up, work harder, and the outcome will always be better than if we just gave up.
