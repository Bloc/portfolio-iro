title: Bloc Experience

Bloc is where my journey into web development really begins.
Bloc is an online bootcamp.  It is approximately a year long commitment and I learned full stack web development with the help of a mentor.  The languages learned include HTML, CSS (bootstrap, Sass), Javascript (Angular 2, jQuery, React) and Ruby (Rails 4 and 5).  I also learned to use git and Github, and completed eight projects including a capstone.  While attending Bloc I worked full time at a kombucha brewery, Rowdy Mermaid, as a brewers assistant.  I eventually bought a van, turned it into a camper, and moved into it so that I could work less and code more.  When I'm not coding chances are I'm climbing, so for my capstone I made a Climber's Log using React.js and Ruby on Rails.  Now that I am graduated from Bloc, I am excited to move on to exciting new projects and a promising new career in web development!
