You start asking yourself what personality traits do they all have in common. The list is short. Here's what I found. It is not scientific.

 In no particular order.

 >The word "No" is not in their vocabulary.
 
 >A quote; "I have never failed at anything, I just don't get it right the first time. Keep trying!"  former software CEO.
 
 >Work Harder!
 
 >Have the guts to take that leap of faith and believe in yourself. 
 
 >Money is not the reason. Reason is process of choice.

I worked for hours and hours on a project. Checked it again and again. My confidence was shacken. I starting questioning my abilities. Starting questioning others. Only to find another set of eyes point out that ATRIBUTE is spelled ATTRIBUTE.
