title: My goals as a software developer
---

For my first blog post, I would like to lay out the goals I have as a software developer.

First, a little history. I remember when I bought my first computer, an Atari 800XL. It's incredible to imagine being excited about a 64KB system nowadays, but I was so excited to have a machine that allowed me to create documents, games, anything that I imagined, albeit in basic 8-bit graphics. The first thing I did was create an image of a truck. After, I used it to type papers and play games. However, it wasn't until I got an internship in high school at Kodak did I understand how useful programming could be. My boss asked me to work on a QuickBasic program to run tests on photoconductors. While I took a long detour teaching English in Korea and China, my interest in coding has never ceased. At the beginning of this year, I decided to sign up for the software developer course at Bloc and finally make coding a career.

One goal is to learn full-stack development. I feel it is important to have a good grasp of all aspects of web development, both front-end and back-end. With an understanding of both sides, I can not only understand how to create a better site but also decide what I really am good at doing. Since this is new, I would like to work in all areas to really understand how it all works together and what I really am passionate about.

Learning many skills isn't very useful without learning the habits, best practices, and thought processes of a skillful programmer. Knowledge of the tools allows one to work in the field but not to excel. When I learned Chinese, it was easy to learn new vocabulary and grammar points, but I couldn't really communicate. Only after learning how to think in Chinese and act in the culture, I was able to converse with native speakers. I feel coding is the same.

In the long term, I would like to combine my interest in coding with my experience as a language learner and teacher. Educational apps, natural language processing, and machine learning are all areas that combine those interests together. This is a life-long process, but being a student and a teacher for most of my life, I have proven to be a life-long learner.
