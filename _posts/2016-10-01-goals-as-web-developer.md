title: My Goals as a Web developer
---
I've spent most of my 20s tinkering around with apps and checking out cool websites, and now that I'm learning how to become a developer, I'm really excited to build these myself.  My first goal is to become a full-stack developer and build some cool web apps.  After that, I want to learn about how to build iOS and Android mobile apps, and how to build Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality projects.  I'm not sure which one I'll want to jump into after I finish my software engineering track at Bloc, but I'm super excited to be starting my journey into this digital world.
