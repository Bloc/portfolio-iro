title:  Technical and marketing communication
---

A large, impenetrable wall separates the marketing from the technical communication departments in companies, and for good reason. On one side of the wall is marketing. They define the strategy for presenting messages and content to the outside world, especially on the web.

On the other side are people doing another kind of communications. They want to help customers get the most out of products. Their messages tend to be more sober and serious in tone because the trust is already there. It's a question of keeping users from leaving.

### A tale of two worlds

Web design as we know it grew out of the marketing world. Starting from a markup language designed to deliver information in a simple way with tags like `<title>` and `<body>`, follow-on styling languages and applications have been hacked into existence ever since.

Web design concerns itself with maximizing usability and attractiveness of content to deliver marketing messages and sell products and services. Technologies enabling web design have evolved at an impressive rate, and they continue to grow at a pace that defies attempts to master them all.

Technical communication, on the other hand, with its text-heavy information design, grew out of bureaucracy. Organizations like the military had tons of advanced equipment but not necessarily the manpower educated to operate that equipment. They also needed to impose uniformity from the top down to promote control and safety. The standard operating procedure was born.

SOPs spread from government to the private sector by way of research and defence companies, and then to large multinationals. Today everyone understands the value of a happy customer, and they promote usability and good technical communication where possible.

### Twin paths

Typically the two departments---marketing and techcomm---have little to say to each other. It's not only that their goals differ; it's also become an "us and them" problem. This is unfortunate, because both departments stand to benefit from more cooperation.

One unfortunate consequence is that few technical writers work with scripting languages or are aware of how these can benefit their output. Tools for both web design and for handling complex information have grown independently.

This means it's very costly to use standard web technologies to document, say, a suite of related products across multiple markets and languages. You need dedicated software like Adobe FrameMaker or MadCap Flare for that.

On the other hand, integrating good UX practices and more graphics in documentation unarguably makes the documentation user friendly.

But the greatest benefit of all would be figuring out how to leverage technical content to sell more products and services. This would be where marketing and technical communication could put in joint efforts.

### Digital transformation

Going digital requires companies to orient themselves to the customer journey and to align all content to buying cycle stages. This promises greater cooperation between different departments as they, together, must assure a better customer experience. But digital transformation is a process only slowly taking hold, and it may be a while yet before technical communication departments wholeheartedly embrace web development.
