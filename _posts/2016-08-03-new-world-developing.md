title: A New World Developing
---
It has been exactly 38 days since I embarked on a journey that has already proven itself to be more than challenging. Just four months ago you would have found me on a very different path, also challenging, but certainly not as satisfying.

I was working in Washington D.C. for a business valuation firm. A large percentage of our clients were technology companies in a myriad of industries. Short of it is, my eyes were opened to a very different world. I quickly began to see the amazing problems being solved. The sky wasn't the limit anymore, nothing was, and I knew I wanted to be apart of it.

Fast forward four months and I'm enrolled in a [Software Engineering Track](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track) (now Software Developer Track) at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/about). I've literally been thrown into the deep end treading the waters of *Ruby* and *Rails*. At this point, I probably can't really tell you what I'm doing. All I can tell you is that I know what it's capable of, and that motivates me to keep treading.

I'm excited and optimistic about this new world that is developing. I have a long and rocky road ahead of me, a road that is going to require a lot, and I mean a lot of work, but I'm okay with that.

If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it - *Steve Jobs*

I have looked for, what seems to me as a long time. And I am confident that I have found it. This new path I fully believe will allow me to be truly satisfied because I know what great work can be achieved by it. Their are so many opportunities to change the world and software engineering in my opinion is one of the best avenues to do so. If you think I'm crazy, don't! Cause you can too.

Sorry for all of the Steve Job's quotes but the guy was brilliant, and certainly in his own way changed the world. If you need any kind of motivation just [click here](https://www.themuse.com/advice/25-steve-jobs-quotes-that-will-change-the-way-you-workin-the-best-way-possible).

Now I'm just blabbing on, which is probably a good signal to stop. To end I will say I'm enthusiastic about this new journey of mine. I look forward to a life of being creative, challenged, solving big problems, and so much more. I have only begun to scratch the surface.
