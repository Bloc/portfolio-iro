title: My Experience at Bloc
--
I'm a couple of months into Bloc's software engineering track now. My interest in tech started last year though, and I started going to some intro coding classes and looking around online for the basics. With so many bootcamps here in Austin, I decided to go with Bloc, because it seemed pretty cool to learn remotely. Perhaps, it would help me to prepare for remote work some day, which would be really exciting. I finally decided it was time to go for it, to try something new and challenging, something that could really give me direction.

Learning remotely does have some extra challenges. It has forced me to find the answers myself. And to learn to handle the frustrations that come with learning something totally new, especially with so much technical knowledge to get familiar with. But I haven't had to get stressed, because my Bloc mentor, Mark Carpenter, has been a great guide. Twice a week we get together using Screenhero and Mark helps me if I'm getting lost. Having a mentor is really important, actually. He has helped me to focus, stay in the right frame of mind, and ship code! As well as giving best practice tools beyond Bloc's lessons. Especially when it comes to using the Dev tools and console for debugging processes.

After learning the basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript the Bloc course jumps right into projects. So, in a couple months, I've gone from functionally illiteracy to having several websites developed. One with jQuery, and two with AngularJS. I've also learned about how websites interact with databases by using Google Firebase for one of my projects. So, it's a cool thing how fast it's all coming along. Which wouldn't have happened I were still trying to piece things together solo.

One very useful thing I've learned from Bloc is which websites are the most useful for research and trouble shooting. Using sites like W3, MDN, and Stack saves so much time. Also, if I weren't working on actual projects, I'd still be messing with sandbox problems. And Bloc has pointed me towards some great recourses like caniuse.com, html5doctor.com, and others.  

Overall, I'm really happy with Bloc. I can tell how much I'm learning and I do think it is a great school, especially for folks who can't do on-campus.
