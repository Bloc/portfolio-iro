title: My journey to becoming a full stack Developer
---
I am a degree holder in Engineering, Electronics and communication, who passed out with good grades.  Coming out of college, confidence was not all there, so life's course took me a different route.  Family responsibilities made me seek other avenues, I worked in the medical field, which obviously I was not very happy about, but stayed put due to flexibility the job offered, and to be there for my daughter, who was little then, was of utmost priority.

End of 2016, my husband, Ken, was diagnosed with Stage 3 cancer, which came as a shocker.  He felt the need to get back to work to support the family after a 6-month hiatus undergoing treatment, which broke my heart.  I felt so helpless and discouraged.  I scoped out my options of what I want to do for myself and for my family.  I researched quite a bit online and found my calling was in web development and decided to pursue that route.  I was very happy about this decision, finally I was able to do what I always wanted to, and I would be able to help the family.  Like the saying goes "everything happens for a reason", I started to see how things were unfolding in my life, I would say the whole experience was nothing less than a divine intervention.

My research online led me to Bloc, whose review on Course Report and SwitchUp were excellent.  I enrolled into their 'online web development appretinceship', the journey started and since then there was no turning back, as I knew this is what I wanted to do.

The great ingenuity involved in software development has always intrigued me, and I want to be a part of it. I have always been passionate about this and wanted it very badly.  The journey with Bloc has been nothing less than that, an inner peace and joy.  I would rate their curriculum excellent.  I was blessed to have wonderful mentors with whom I had two one-on-one meetings every week.  They were always there, just an e-mail away, to help me through the course.  My backend mentor had 30+ years web development experience and came with vast knowledge from whom I learnt quite a bit.

Bloc curriculum also helped me understand how prepared I have to be for job interviews.  They conducted assessments at the end of Modules, which I took very seriously, reviewed my course work thoroughly to be ready for the assessment and passed all 3 assessments.  They had these small videos in between the curriculum to boost our morale and to keep us encouraged through the curriculum, which helped me stay focused, committed, and disciplined.  These videos always brought a smile on my face.  It showed how much Bloc cared for their students to reach their goal.

I know for sure that working in web development will not feel like work as I enjoy being part of it.  My goal is to be a better and a confident javascript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails programmer, and would like to learn React eventually.
