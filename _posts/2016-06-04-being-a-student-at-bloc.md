title: Being a student at Bloc
---

I took Bloc's [Frontend Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) course with the 16 week option. My day job was less than full time, which allowed me to do this.

Before signing up, I researched a number of options. As I'm not sure when I'll have time again to take a half-year course, I wanted a learning experience that would offer maximum impact in terms of gaining knowledge while providing opportunities to actually build complex stuff. My view is that just doing programming exercises is like learning how to use a hammer and nail while using skills to build the facade of a small house is an entirely different undertaking.

### Getting started

What appealed to me about Bloc was the fact it offered project-based work and requires commitment, which somewhat mirrors the real world. The program matches you with a mentor who is a full-time software developer, lending a professional angle when discussing assignments.

Bloc recommends doing some prework before starting. This consists of mini introductory courses in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a little GitHub. They are offered by [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com) and are free.

Personally I found these to be beneficial and am glad to have done such basic work outside of Bloc. I felt my nearly five-month course at Bloc may have taught the basics of frontend development, but there's so much to learn that it scarcely seems enough. 

Next I had to select a mentor. Being based in Switzerland means there's a time difference with the US, so I had to find someone who wanted to work, say, during mornings their time. When browsing the profiles, I noticed many of them expressed interest in startups and were even involved with these (while mentoring!). Such profiles seemed to cluster on the West Coast. For my purposes, I wanted a software development professional and not necessarily someone to talk business with. In my view there are plenty of resources for getting support with your startup and I wouldn't necessarily look for them in a technical course.

I was happy with the mentor I selected. He has broad experience in software and was generally always available to answer questions. I can recommend him to anyone who wants to learn software development.

### Doing the projects

Bloc's course is structured in terms of projects, which in turn are divided up into checkpoints, each presenting different topics to learn and work through. The majority of time you're working through the first, or Foundation project, in which you learn the basics of building an app from the ground up. This includes adding the HTML and CSS first, followed by JavaScript. 

Although the checkpoints sometimes throw a lot of new concepts at you, I think checkpoints are a good system for seeing first hand how a complex app is built from scratch. After the Foundation, you can choose from any number of smaller projects to learn specialized areas that interest you.

### Time commitment

Reading some pages on the Bloc website about what to expect, I somehow calculated around four hours per day of frontend work. Many times this involved more. When code didn't work as expected or at all, I sometimes spent many hours trying different variations or googling and reading. Many of my searches led me to StackOverflow and its advice but I found that the answers there are not always usable. It was important for me to understand what I was doing (though that wasn't always the case) and this demanded a lot of time.

Another aspect of time commitment is that you're always aware of the pressure to finish as many checkpoints as possible before the course ends. As I'm the kind of learner who gets more out of doing things at a more leisurely pace, I'm looking forward to accessing the course materials after I'm done.

My family will probably also be happy that my course at Bloc is ending.

### Wrapping up

These are my experiences with Bloc and I'm sure it'll be different for others. One thing to expect is that after finishing, you're certainly not going to know everything there is to know. It's important to keep in mind that completing the course puts you at the start of something and not at the end.
