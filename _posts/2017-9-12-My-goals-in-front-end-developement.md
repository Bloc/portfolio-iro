title: My goals in front end development
--
I'm still at the beginning of this journey. I just want to keep learning what's possible. I want to get better at understanding the logical processes involved in javascript functions. I'm also curious to learn more about design, perhaps how different sciences like color-therapy could be used.

I've started paying more attention to the websites I go to. Which ones I like, that are more interactive, more functional. And which ones I don't like, that aren't interactive and seem lazy or sloppy. 

I want to be able to take pride in my work, especially as a creator. What I create is a reflection of myself, inside and outside of work. So I'm going to continue learning and improving my skills to prepare myself for the real world.

The Trivium Method is a mental tool I use when I'm trying to understand something new. Trivium basically breaks things down into three levels. The first is grammar. Grammar is about understanding all of the building blocks, all the html tags, css properties and their values, javascript lists, objects, methods, etc.. The next level is Logic. Logic is about how all of the grammar, building blocks, fit together. Which ones work well together and which are less effective. Why is one function better built than another? Would a conditional statement work here? Can this be solved with a loop? The third level is rhetoric. Rhetoric is when you understand the grammar and logic of a subject so well that you can teach it. Rhetoric is the finished product, what you have to show.

So, this is an example of how I'm trying to apply what I've learned in life into development. I'm also trying to read up on the different companies and start ups here in Austin and elsewhere. So far Golden Frog is the place that has interested me the most. Their work relates to internet privacy products and advocacy. I would like to work somewhere that is socially and ethically conscious.
