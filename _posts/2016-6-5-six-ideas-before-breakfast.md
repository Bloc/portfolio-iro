title: Six ideas before breakfast
---
> "I can't believe that!" said Alice.<br>
"Can't you?" the Queen said in a pitying tone. "Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes."<br>
Alice laughed. "There's no use trying," she said: "one can't believe impossible things."<br>
"I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

This is my blog. I have loads of ideas that I want to save in a safer place than the four different notebooks, countless scraps of paper and Google Keep (Google?, y u no let me indent/nest my lists?). I have lots of interests, and <sarcastic>you can tell how creative I am by how messy my workspaces are </sarcastic>. They are very messy.

I ...
* am a software engineering student at [Bloc.io,](https://www.bloc.io/software-engineering-track)
* have a bachelor's in communication with minors in philosophy and music,
* worked at the local NPR and PBS affiliates here in Boise while going to school,
* was a teacher for 7 years after college,
* am currently starting a custom software development business,
* am passionate about civics and politics,
* am a husband and dad of two (soon to be three!),
* and really [like to garden](https://goo.gl/photos/zF94bxuRndY5ejip8).

This blog will document and share the ideas and projects that I do, as well as the ones I would really like to do... but don't have time because... well, because mortgages.

And like any blog - it's also somewhere to discuss those ideas, so please comment like crazy down there! Thanks!
