title: Six ideas before breakfast

> "I can't believe that!" said Alice.<br>
"Can't you?" the Queen said in a pitying tone. "Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes."<br>
Alice laughed. "There's no use trying," she said: "one can't believe impossible things."<br>
"I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

I have lots of interests, and &#60;sarcastic&#62; you can tell how creative I am by how messy my workspaces are &#60;/sarcastic&#62;. They are very messy.</p>
