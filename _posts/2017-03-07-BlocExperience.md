title: Beginning as a Bloc Student
---

Being a Bloc student is quite different from studying in a traditional classroom.

For one, your classroom is your home, a coffee shop or wherever you decide to study. I am holed up in my basement, shielded from the distractions of my family on the floors above.

Second, the classes are checkpoints which walk you through the steps in making various applications. I have created two music players and this blog, learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Angular in the process. Gradually, the checkpoints require more independence asking the student to solve more problems on their own.

Another difference is my teacher is a mentor that I meet twice a week. In the time track that I have chosen, I spend 25-30 hours a week working on the material. When I finish, I submit the checkpoints with the mentor for approval. In our weekly meetings, we go over any problems or concerns that we have and practice using the concepts learned in the course.

Finally, the course requires the student to be motivated and willing to struggle through problems on their own. The mentor is their to help when you get stuck, but really the learning comes from struggling with problems and trying to figure them out on your own. So many times have I wanted to bash my head on a wall because I was stuck on a problem only to take a break, come back with a fresh perspective and solve the problem in 5 minutes. I've been told this right of passage is necessary to become a solid programmer, and I'm starting to understand this truth.
