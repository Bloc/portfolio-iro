My road to web development has just begun. I've learned so much already, and I'm excited about what I have yet to learn. Discover my journey!

### Finding My Passion

It's a scary thing, changing careers.

Since graduating from <a href="http://www.lipscomb.edu/" target="_blank">Lipscomb University</a> in 2011, I've held sales/marketing positions in three very different industries. There's always an adjustment period, but I never needed a brand new education. Then I met Web Development.

It began as a useful tool to enhance my company's WordPress website, but it quickly turned into a series of search engine queries and late nights coding along with tutorial videos. I couldn't get enough. I loved learning <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, which naturally led me to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. But knowing the structural and stylistic fundamentals of web design wasn't quite enough to satisfy me. I knew I needed to learn JavaScript.

### Getting Started with an Online Bootcamp

I quickly discovered that while it was relatively easy to learn the foundations of HTML and CSS on my own, JavaScript presented brand new challenges.

I got married in March of 2016, and for the first few months of our marriage, I made several mentions of wanting to learn web development. Finally, my wife told me to stop talking about it and do something about it. It was just the nudge I needed.

After a lot of research and a few coffee meetings with developer friends, I chose a part-time course by <a href="https://www.bloc.io/" target="_blank">Bloc</a>. I work full-time and don't want to sacrifice time with my wife, so the part-time program fits into my life nicely.

### My Experience So Far

I'm now four months into my 12-month program at Bloc, and I've already built [a web app for playing music]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/blocjams.md %}), similar to Spotify. I'm continuing to develop my portfolio as I learn more advanced programming skills.

This has been a very rewarding experience so far. I've enjoyed learning new web development techniques and skills, and I enjoy the challenges of finding appropriate solutions. Sometimes it's frustrating when I can't seem to come to a working solution, but that makes success all the more rewarding.

One of the greatest qualities of a Bloc bootcamp program is the one-on-one mentorship. A professional web developer is a powerful resource when learning to code. I have a weekly virtual meeting with my mentor, and he is able to message with me throughout the week to help me when I'm stuck.

Another understated, yet remarkably useful, part of the curriculum at Bloc is the training in popular developer programs and resources. I'm not only learning to code; I'm also learning how to use developer resources like Git, Slack, Chrome Dev Tools, and JavaScript libraries like Buzz and jQuery.

### More Miles to Go

I'm only about a third of the way through my bootcamp program&mdash;and it feels like I've accomplished a lot&mdash;but there are a lot more miles to go in my journey to web development. Even as a professional web developer, I'll continue to learn and challenge myself, which is something I'm very much looking forward to.
