  Why I'm learning React.  Reason number one: It's fun! After spending months focusing on Ruby on Rails I am having a blast learning about React and Redux. Reason two: React native makes cross platform development a breeze. Instead of learning Kotlin and Swift I can just expand on React. Cool! As Ruby is built around object oriented programming it has been interesting to learn about functional programming, one-way data flow, and immutable data. I am quite excited to be developing for mobile as well as web. More to come in the future about adventures in React!
