title: Why I decided I had to learn full stack development
---
I had been designing ever since I was 16. I was accidentally placed in Advanced Web Design II when I was 16 as a Jr. in at Murrieta Mesa High School.

I fell in love with the thought of being able to express my creativity though a career that I saw had a lot of up side in the business world. Coming from a mother who was a real estate coach and business owner I picked up the entrepreneur bug from her and saw that I could make money on the side fast by creating logos and marketing materials for all my mothers friends who were also in Real Estate.

Before I knew it was out form under of creating $10 logos for my moms real estate friends and landed my first full time gig at 18 from Digital Telepathy(One of if not the best design firm in San Diego). After months learning the ropes of what it was like working with other designs and project managers I decided to move onto my own gig and start my own design firm from all the leads I collected through dribbble.

After working for hundreds of startups helping the CEO of which ever company with their vision I just felt there was a ceiling with the design Industry.

Since the age of 16 when I first begin understanding there was a career with design Iâ€™ve always wanted to build out my ideas. I knew I would have to face the fear of learning something from scratch once again even though I know basic HTML and CSS and am ready for the journey
