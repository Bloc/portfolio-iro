When I started the bloc Full Stack Web Developer software program I had one primary goal... learn as much as I could from this experience. 

My programming experience prior to Bloc was and ancient language known as fanuc. I had some exposure to the Java, that kinda of ended after some simple tutorials. So, what was Ruby and how was it on Rails. Front-End, Back-End. I soon found that this world of programming languages had evolutes quite fast. Why Ruby and not Java, or Python, or C++, even Swift.
