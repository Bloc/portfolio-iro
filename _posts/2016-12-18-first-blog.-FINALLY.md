title: My very first blog post. FINALLY!!!! :D 
---

So, it's *finally* here. Alright, take a breath.

My first blog post. I'll save everyone the eyeball resources of reading that I've always wanted to do this, never had the time, right motivation. I would however like to write about having the right motivation, and why I feel all the planets have aligned for this to happen.

1.&nbsp;I'm **finally** out of the hardware industry! Or rather, I aligned myself with a job that is purely software based. Not like companies that say they are software companies, but you have to purchase their hardware to have the software work **cough**Cisco**cough**.

2.&nbsp;I'm **finally** committing some time to share some of my ideas with the world. I'm not a fan of facebook (although I do keep it for keeping in contact with people I've met in all walks of life), and I use LinkedIn (but that's more for professional/resume type information). This blog is giving me the opportunity to reach out to the world about my tech endeavors, findings, learnings, and creations!

3.&nbsp;I'm **finally** designing my portfolio page! Blog posts are part of that. There are things that I've learned in the dark arts of field engineering and customer service that I'd not want to take to the grave.... whoa that got dark real quick.

4.&nbsp;I'm **finally** working at a company that doesn't impose closed source, propietary operating systems as a norm for work laptops and machines! Nuggets of Linux and open source goodness to ensue, balancing open source desire and production requirements. Yay!

5.&nbsp;I'm **finally** creating code as part of my job! Yea! My boss has already asked me to write some things in Python to analyze the Bajillion metric TON-o-kilograms of data points that a customer has collected for it's performance enhancements. Data has been decoded, parsed, and served for yummy data science analysis consumption.

My plan for these blogs is to share with everyone my experiences in information about Linux, Python, Coding bootcamp experiences, javascript, Web Development, tech industry nuances, computer network know how, packet theory, OSI model concepts and application concepts, SDN experiences, and just life stuff in general.

My immediate goals are to learn a lot about technology. Specifically, my tech goals are to continue working and providing some semblance of professional code at the company of my employ, apply the dark arts of Solutions Engineering to prospective customers, finish the coding bootcamp that I started early November, and at some point get an RHCSA (that will lead to an RHCE).

Big goals, but I have always felt very happy learing and applying technologies.

On a personal side, I'd like to continue rock climbing. A hobby I picked up in May of this year. I've gotten good at it, as I try to think as much as I can before hitting the rock, and exerting myself as little as possible. I pack a nice belly, so exerting as little effort as possible, and using as much of my legs as I can instead of my forearms, arms, and torso is good. It's also a lot of fun, and looks pretty cool if you're watching.

In any case, I'm signing off for now. Have a great one! :D
