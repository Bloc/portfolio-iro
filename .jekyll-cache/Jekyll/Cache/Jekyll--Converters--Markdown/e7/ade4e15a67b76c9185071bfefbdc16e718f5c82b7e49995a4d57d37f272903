I"|<p>Coffee loving, code writing, Scotch sipping, Linux enthusiast here! I consider myself a technological journeyman with a love for cycling, bouldering (at <a href="https://brooklynboulders.com/gowanus/">BKB</a>), as well as an on again off again love for video games.</p>

<p>My favorite coffee bean is <a href="https://www.orensdailyroast.com/shopProduct.aspx?Product_Id=9&amp;SubCategory=148&amp;GenCat=1&amp;Category=1&amp;Title=Coffee&amp;image=False">Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</a>.</p>

<p>My preferred Linux distro is <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/">Debian Stable</a> (<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">though</a> I’ve <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">been</a> around <a href="https://getfedora.org/">the block</a>).</p>

<p>When it comes to Scotch, I tend to gravitate towards single malts with full flavor profiles of peat/smoke with hints of iodine, hence my favoring Scotches from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay">Islay</a> region. In no particular order, my tried and true favorite Scotches are <a href="http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&amp;search=15752&amp;searchtype=Contains">Laphroaig Quarter Cask</a>, <a href="http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&amp;search=37788&amp;searchtype=Contains">Lagavulin 16 year Single Malt</a>, <a href="http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&amp;search=31336&amp;searchtype=Contains">Port Charlotte Scottish Barley</a>.</p>

<p>To round off the “favorites” topics with something code relevant, I enjoy writing in Python, chuffed at the lovely syntactic sugar of Ruby, appreciate the strictness of Java, and have weaned myself from abusing the permissiveness of Javascript.</p>

<p>Oh also bee-tee-dubz, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierortiz">I’ve got university degrees, recommendations, certificates, specializations, and continuous learning achievements and interests</a>… if that’s what you’re into checking out.</p>

<p>Though life and <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adulting">adulting</a> can be challenging, I try to make some time to get the blood flowing in the morning by cycling, running, and/or bouldering at the gym. Though recently don’t have a lot of personal alone time left over after all is said and done in the day, I am particularly fond of a sandbox space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">MMORPG</a> called <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=420d09fc-3559-4317-b9da-202c8ec0ab65">Eve Online</a> recently. In a nutshell, I get to blow up internet spaceships for fun and have been part of <a href="https://imperium.news/breaking-news-supercap-fight-wicked-creek/">huge</a> space <a href="https://imperium.news/ualx-3-battle-aftermath-camping-operations-in-effect/">battles</a> (pew pewz!).</p>

<p>Plans for the 2H of 2018 and 2019:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Renew zipcar for road trips with friends and fam. National Parks, B&amp;Bs, &amp; local breakfast haunts to explore.</li>
  <li>Take up <a href="www.nyrr.org">NYRR</a> races again and train to run a half marathon.</li>
  <li>Start holding dinner parties at home.</li>
</ol>
