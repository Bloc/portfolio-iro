I"¶<p>This past Christmas weekend, I set up my first portfolio website, itâ€™s up and running for the world to see! I also have www.xavierjortiz.com pointing at it currently too! (more on setting up my custom domain in another post).</p>

<p>I was pleaseantly surprised how easy it was! I had some issues initially pointing at this page. Mainly because my github repo was called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">portfolio-io</code>. Once I renamed the website to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xavier-j-ortiz.github.io</code>, itâ€™s behavior was correct.</p>

<p>After that, it github automatically published the jekyll website that I had forked and modified to make my own from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">portfolio-iro</code>. Iâ€™m quite surprised and feeling happy about how easy and seamless it was to setup.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this github.io page tracks the master branch of the jekyll page that is hosted on my github.com page!</p>

<p>I added a couple of analytics tags. I added google analytics tags, just to see what kind of traffic Iâ€™m attracting. Never had I previously thought the amount of analytics that a small website, that feels experimental right now, could be tracked.</p>

<p>In this website, there are tags from Cedexis. I currently work for them. We provide a service that allows website admins and companies to provide the best end user experience for the people who are accessing the website or web services.</p>

<p>There is an automated and customizable logic that can be created via javascript involved with what Cedexis does, but at itâ€™s core, it anonymously collects data from the real web users and uses this information to make the best decision for the best quality of services to your website or web service.</p>

<p>More on this in another post <em>wink</em> <em>wink</em>. :D</p>

<p>For now, Iâ€™ll leave it at that, and will expand this in the following weeks.</p>
