I was born in sunny Santa Monica, California six blocks from the beach. When I'm not coding, I love to be outside going on some adventure. It could be snowboarding back-country,
rock climbing, or urban explortion. I'm always up for a good road trip and won't ever pass up a culinary adventure.

My adventure support team consists of my wife, daughter and our two yorkies (Roxy and Gibson).

This journal will document my journey down the rabbit hole of coding, and other adventures...
