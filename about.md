I'm a marketing assistant in the financial services sector and a student of web development working toward a rewarding career building web applications.

The verticals that have piqued my interest are education, finance, and health care, but I'm open to new opportunites, wherever they may place me. Check out my [pre-development r&#233;sum&#233;](http://127.0.0.1:4000/resume/) for a better understanding of where I've been, and read my posts to get a feel for where I'm going.

Be sure to check back here often. I'm working hard to build my portfolio and carve out a career in web development. I look forward to impressing you.
