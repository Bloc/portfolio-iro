Hey there!  Here's a little about me.  I'm a freelance web developer living in Boulder, Colorado (when I'm not traveling in my van).  I started my journey into web development with Bloc, an online, full stack web dev bootcamp.  The languages I focus on are JavaScript and Ruby.  When im not writing code I'm most likely climbing in the beautiful Rocky Mountains.  I also enjoy hiking, craft beer, disc golfing, and my dog, Chalupa.
