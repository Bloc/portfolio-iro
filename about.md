I am a teacher of English as a Second Language, father of two, fluent speaker of Chinese, and an aspiring software developer. After graduating with a degree in Philosophy, with a pass through the physics and computer science departments, from the University of Buffalo, I spent 12 years living, working, and studying language in Korea and China. I have been living in New York City for almost 8 years and enjoy all of the cultural offerings available. Currently, I am enrolled in the Bloc Software Developer course.
