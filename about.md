Hi! I'm Steve and thanks for visiting the About page.

I'm currently enrolled in an online [Software Engineering](https://www.bloc.io/software-developer-track) program through [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/about). I have no prior programming experience, and would not consider myself to be technologically sophisticated one iota. However, I'm on a fast track to change that, and I mean fast.

This website is a place for me to showcase my portfolio, current projects, and anything else I want to share with others. My hope is it will also provide to be a source of inspiration for anyone interested or currently in related fields.

Aside from all that, I'm happily married with a wild and crazy one year old. If I'm not sitting in front of a computer trying to figure out some broken code or mind blowing programming concept, I'm usually outside running, surfing, biking, climbing, or chilling with my fam.

Hope you enjoy and happy hacking!
