Hey there!  Here's a little about me.  I'm a freelance web/mobile developer living in Boulder, Colorado.  I would love to help you build your next website or app!  I specialize in single page web and mobile applications.  Check out the contact page to get the ball rolling.  I started my journey into web development with Bloc, an online, full stack web dev bootcamp.  The languages I focus on are JavaScript and Ruby.  When im not writing code I'm most likely climbing in the beautiful Rocky Mountains.  I also enjoy hiking, craft beer, disc golf, and my dog, Chalupa.
