Dad. Gardener. Wizard in training.

I worked at KBSU (the local NPR affiliate) and IdPTV (tne local PBS affiliate) in master controll and as a production assistant until I graduated from Boise State University in 2002 with a communications degree. After graduation, I received a teacher's certificate from Prescott College and taught speech and English and was the technical coordinator at an online charter school. I then moved into corporate training / instructional design and spent a year as an A\V programmer (Crestron and BiAmp products).

I am now the communications manager and Jr. Developer at Next Step Tech, a software, websites, and mobile applications development house in Boise.

Developing great software takes more than just technical knowledge; it takes teamwork - which requires great communication and leadership skills; and it takes creativity - both for design and logical problem solving.
