As you have guessed by now, my name is Liz Green and I'm a Ruby on Rails Junior Developer. I started my dev journey in early 2015, and I'm super excited to continue growing. I'm originally from Nicaragua, but I live in the beautiful city of Chicago. I enjoy coding, reading, watching movies, and weightlifting. 

As I learn, I would like to collaborate with others on any Ruby projects. If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to contact me.
