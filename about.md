Coffee loving, code writing, Scotch sipping, Linux enthusiast here! I consider myself a technological journeyman with a love for cycling, bouldering (at [BKB](https://brooklynboulders.com/gowanus/)), as well as an on again off again love for video games. 

My favorite coffee bean is [Ethiopian Yirgacheffe](https://www.orensdailyroast.com/shopProduct.aspx?Product_Id=9&SubCategory=148&GenCat=1&Category=1&Title=Coffee&image=False).

My preferred Linux distro is [Debian Stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/) ([though](https://www.gentoo.org/) I've [been](https://www.archlinux.org/) around [the block](https://getfedora.org/)). 

When it comes to Scotch, I tend to gravitate towards single malts with full flavor profiles of peat/smoke with hints of iodine, hence my favoring Scotches from the [Islay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay) region. In no particular order, my tried and true favorite Scotches are [Laphroaig Quarter Cask](http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&search=15752&searchtype=Contains), [Lagavulin 16 year Single Malt](http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&search=37788&searchtype=Contains), [Port Charlotte Scottish Barley](http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&search=31336&searchtype=Contains). 

To round off the "favorites" topics with something code relevant, I enjoy writing in Python, chuffed at the lovely syntactic sugar of Ruby, appreciate the strictness of Java, and have weaned myself from abusing the permissiveness of Javascript.

Oh also bee-tee-dubz, [I've got university degrees, recommendations, certificates, specializations, and continuous learning achievements and interests](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierortiz)... if that's what you're into checking out.

Though life and [adulting](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adulting) can be challenging, I try to make some time to get the blood flowing in the morning by cycling, running, and/or bouldering at the gym. Though recently don't have a lot of personal alone time left over after all is said and done in the day, I am particularly fond of a sandbox space [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) called [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=420d09fc-3559-4317-b9da-202c8ec0ab65) recently. In a nutshell, I get to blow up internet spaceships for fun and have been part of [huge](https://imperium.news/breaking-news-supercap-fight-wicked-creek/) space [battles](https://imperium.news/ualx-3-battle-aftermath-camping-operations-in-effect/) (pew pewz!).

Plans for the 2H of 2018 and 2019:
1. Renew zipcar for road trips with friends and fam. National Parks, B&Bs, & local breakfast haunts to explore.
2. Take up [NYRR](www.nyrr.org) races again and train to run a half marathon. 
3. Start holding dinner parties at home.
