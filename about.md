Hello, I am Sarah Binion and I am a designer and UI developer living in Chicago. I believe that great design is created though communication and storytelling. I am particularly fond of UX, infographics, and css. 

Born and raised in Wisconsin, (yes, I love beer and cheese), I received a BS in Art with an emphasis in Visual Design from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am an active member of the AIGA, UX Book Club, ChiDuXX, Chicago HTML5, a Starter League UX alumna, and a Bloc.io Front-End alumna.
