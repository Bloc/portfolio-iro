I am a teacher of English as a Second Language, father of two, fluent speaker of Chinese, and an aspiring software developer. After spending 12 years living, working, and studying language in Korea and China, I have settled in New York City. I try to learn from every project I work on and develop my coding skills. Have an idea or an opportunity? Let me know how I can help!
