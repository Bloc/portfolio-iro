My team, the Stellar Folds, and I created a mesh network of self propelling origami robots to be deployed on the surface of Mars. During this challenge I was in charge of research, documentation, testing, and social media presence. My research consisted of finding prototypes already in existence. I also was responsible for all research pertaining to Mars and it's terrain and climate. In terms of documentation I edited photos and videos I took throughout the 48 hours we worked on the project. When it came to testing our prototypes, I had the pleasure of deploying them and recording their successes or failures. Throughout the whole competition I made sure to keep our social media presence up through Tumblr and Twitter so that the competition judges would notice us before judging, and we were successful!
