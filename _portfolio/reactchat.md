short-description: A chatroom application created in React

---
This is a webapp created when learning about React. The application allows you to register your Name from a google account. Once registered, you can create a room, post messages in a room, and interact with other people that are also in these rooms.

On the backend, it uses google firebase in storing the room and message information. The framework used to create this website is React. 

This application is hosted on a Debian Stable linode instance and is using NGINX as it's webserver. It can be accessed at this location: [https://www.xavierjortiz.com/chatroom/](https://www.xavierjortiz.com/chatroom/)
