short-description: A Reddit Clone Where People can Post, Vote on, Share, and Save Links and Comments.

## Summary
This web application was built as part of my Bloc.io foundation course in Ruby on Rails and contains multiple examples the features offered by Rails in order to demonstrate different methods of implementation for these features. It was built using a workflow based in Git and Heroku.

## Explanation
This application is inspired by the popular web site Reddit. Reddit is a robust community comprised of a simple voting system used to rank shared links and user comments. The voting system creates an environment where the most interesting and useful links, and nested comments about them, rise to the top of a reading queue. This is a great system for sharing and collaborating on more than just humorous links, it is a foundation for any large community to collaborate with.

## The problem
It is difficult to encourage individuals to actively participate in large groups, most people would rather just watch or listen, and don't actively participate. The web allows for large groups to share information more easily than before, but asynchronous communications can quickly get disjointed and unwieldy.

These problems exist for any large group on the web, and Reddit has solved these problems well, but the Redditor community can be juvenile at times, evidenced by it's large body of NSFW content, and because it was the first of it's kind, there is at least one subreddit (a topic/category for links to be shared and commented on) for absolutely everything! But no website can be everything for everybody. Professionals and interests groups have a desire to share and collaborate on their topics of interest - but within a culture and aesthetic of their own, not Reddit's.

## The solution
This app, Bloccit, serves as a demonstration for a foundational Rails app, that can be customized into the needs of any specialized group. Teachers, for example, could use a site to share and comment on lesson plans. Bloccit could be easily adapted to their needs. Students also could use this as a foundation for an app that shares media like a modern school newspaper with the votes functioning as likes, gaining insight into levels of interest on various topics instead of a sorting mechanism.

## Results
Results are currently mixed. I have solved the problem of building a demonstration of my skills using Ruby on Rails, but I have yet to take this application to it's full potential. I am now moving on to the front-end portion of my schooling and will return to this project with those skills at hand.

## Conclusion
Reddit has made interacting with very large groups, seem like familiar communities, but Reddit cannot be everybody's community. The web allows for niche groups across the world to band together and share knowledge and to grow and flourish from each other's opinions and observations. Each of these groups have their own culture and aesthetic and so need their own app to reflect them. Bloccit will serve me well as the foundation for these apps to come.
