### Summary

Bloccit is a replica of Reddit created with direction from the curriculum at Bloc for educational purposes. It was my very first functional application and my first to be deployed on Heroku.

### Explanation

For this project Bloc provided guidance through mentor support as well as a detailed curriculum that explained how to create the program step by step. By working through the steps to create Bloccit I both created a Reddit replica but also in each checkpoint worked assignments in a separate branch to create potential features while continuing to progress forwards on the master branch.

### Results

Overall, the project was a success. Creating Bloccit was my first experience with Git and Github, working with gem’s, working in a TDD environment, working with the command line in depth and overall just creating a functional program. This was the first step, a small step but one nonetheless.

### Conclusion

As this project was my first coding creation I am very proud of it. It was very instructive and also empowering as it showed me that I could work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AJAX, API’s, HTML & CSS and actually create something.
