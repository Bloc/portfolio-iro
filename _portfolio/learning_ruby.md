short-description: An introduction to the Ruby Programming Language

---
Learning Ruby was the fun and easy part of [Bloc's Ruby on Rails Web Developer](https://www.bloc.io/web-development-bootcamp) program . It requires students to learn some basics, including [HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), before starting. The program requires nothing more than the sort of solid background found at many places online, and I used everything I learned at some point throughout the rest of the course.

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a web application framework designed to make creating functional websites easier and somewhat standardized. Ruby is a dynamic, and dynamically typed, object-oriented programming language. The introductory portion of Bloc, after setting up the programming environment, includes the basics of Ruby such as variables, arrays and hashes, classes and methods, flow control, and blocks.

[Rspec](http://rspec.info/), a Domain Specific Language for testing Ruby, is briefly introduced and used throughout the Ruby learning to verify submitted code in the assignments editor.

I found the Rspec detracted from learning Ruby, as I was not used to rigid requirements for writing small snippets of code taken out of  context. For me, the joy of programming was always tackling the algorithmic solution of the problem being coded: breaking it down into logical components, then building it up into a functioning program by coding the pieces. If I picked my components well, I could code them in any language, top-down Pascal or object-oriented Java.

To move on from my frustrations with Rspec, I wrote my code using an Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB) in my terminal or at [repl.it](https://repl.it/), an online IRB or Ruby language shell, or just in text files that I ran in my shell on a Virtual Machine, then, after thoroughly debugging the code snippets, I pasted them into my assignments editor and adjusted them to the assignment's Rspec.

![I used a Debian Virtual Machine on an Oracle Virtual Box. There was a steep learning curve to set up the VM on my 64-bit laptop. I used the Oracle Virtual Box that I had leftover from a [Cyber Infrastructures course at the University of Arizona](http://cclnd.blogspot.com/2014/12/applied-cyber-infrastructure-class-at-u.html). I started with Ubuntu, but my mentor suggested a switch to Debian. It took me a while to get the screen resized to occupy as much landscape as possible on my laptop's screen. ]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/learning_ruby/learning_ruby_002.jpg)

Only towards the end of the program did I understand that the rigidity of Rspec is part of its value, that by creating all variables within the spec and by not using either the development or production databases during testing, Rspec protected data and was more focused on what was being tested.

Also, if I wrote the Rspec myself, in a red-green-refactor mode, I would not have been as annoyed with it, as I would have had to have known the problem better, then identified components to test. I am writing my own Rspec for programs and successfully using it in its intended way.

I can do light programming in Ruby at the level required to write a basic usable Rails application. I want to be more proficient at Ruby, so I am writing a game using mostly Ruby.

At this point, I am still unsure about how the Rails works, and I prefer an old-fashioned textbook as a resource to jumping all over online to find information of varying quality. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) answers are maddeningly specific when it seems a general question is being asked or vice-versa. Language documentation is hard to understand as a beginner.
