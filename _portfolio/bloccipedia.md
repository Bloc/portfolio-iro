short-description: A SaaS Wiki-Pages Collaboration Tool

---
## Summary
Bloccipedia is inspired by Wikipedia, in that the pages are collaboratively edited, but in addition to enabling collaboratively generating the content, Bloccipedia allows users to choose and editing a theme, and then publishing the results to a low-cost web-server.

## Explanation
Modern content management systems (CMS's) have made it easy for people to create web-pages through abstracting the specialized knowledge of templates and databases away from the average user allowing for everyone to easily manage their own website. Bloccipedia is a centrally hosted CMS similar to Wordpress.com.

## The problem
The cost of Wordpress.com or paying hosting for a self-installed version of Wordpress.org is not free. Also, because they attempt to create a platform that will work for everyone, they are more complicated than needed for the majority of their users.

## The solution
Bloccipedia makes it easy for anyone to display content on the web. It generates static web files that are nearly free to host.

## Results
I am still integrating jekyll, the system that will generate the static pages, as well as the system to choose and edit a theme.

It is a work in progress. It is successful as a proof of concept for authenticating users that are able to collaborate on public and private pages.
