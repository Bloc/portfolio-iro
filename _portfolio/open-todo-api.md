short-description: An External API with Authentication

## Summary
This was the third project for the Ruby on Rails portion while a student at Bloc. It is a to-do list API. It has no way of viewing the lists and items but rather is intended to serve as a back-end to serve any number of different views. A mobile to-do list application, a trello-like web application, or another part of a larger web-app for example.   

## Explanation
API's are the highway system that connect the cities and neighborhoods across all the states of the united highway system of the modern web. You can often log into an application and access your data through many different means; through a mobile phone app downloaded from the play or itunes store, through any browser on a desktop or laptop, and more commonly everyday, through a voice driven interface like Alexa, or 'OK, Google'. There is only one set of data and one set of functions to manipulate that data, but there are many interfaces, or views, into that data. It is through an API that the individual views are connected to the data.   

## The problem
A common issue with lists are that they are often not where you need them, when you need them. The shopping list left on the counter at home, or the kids chore list is nowhere near the TV (and thus failing to remind them to do their chores before growing roots into the couch for the evening). Also, frequently two or more people are sharing the list with multiple copies. Then, when one item is completed by a team-member, the others aren't notified, and may also complete the task - wasting time instead of saving it.  

## The solution
One list with many locations? An API to the rescue. With a mobile phone based view, when you go shopping, you'll have the list with you if you have your phone with you, and when do we ever not have our phones with us anymore? Multiple people using the list? Marking the item as done will be reflected on everyone's view of the list. I am now even considering writing a program for a micro-controller that opens a locked box only after the kids' chores are all marked complete - and then placing our TV remote inside the box.

## Results
The API funtions well. Views need to be created as needed. This is a great framework for my first mobile applications, as well as for my first micro-controller application. I will update my progress here and at [the blog]({{ site.url }}/posts)

#Conclusion
APIs are an important and growing application of ruby on rails - Rails v5.0 will include them as a core function rather than an add-on gem or to be hand-coded in. This application was built to demonstrate my ability to create and utilize them. Do you have an idea of how it could be used? Please leave a comment below!
