short-description: Bloccitoff is a simple web-based checklist for things to do.

---
Bloccitoff is a simple web app that allows you to create a list of things to do. Every item that is added to the list must be completed within 7 days. If you complete them before then, you can mark them as done. Otherwise, they will be automatically wiped after that time.
