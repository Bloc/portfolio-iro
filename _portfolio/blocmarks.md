### Summary

Blocmarks is a social bookmarking application that allows users to email, manage and share bookmarked URLs and was created with the help of a loose framework from the Bloc curriculum. This was my second project developed with my mentor, also developed for educational purposes, and required more independent design and implementation.

### Explanation

This particular project was one of the eight available independent projects under the Rails Web Development track at Bloc of which a student selects two to work on during the course. In creating this program the course provides a loose framework of user stories it expects to have implemented and some suggestions but ultimately allows for greater freedom in the actual creation of the code itself and implementation approach. As this project was more independent than any prior projects it allowed for more experimentation and much more work with gems and their requisite API’s which was both a challenge but also very rewarding.

### Results

As my second project in the course and my second functioning application created I would say that Blocmarks was a success. I designed and wrote the code on my own for the first time with some guidance from both the curriculum and my mentor but ultimately on my own. From a functional perspective the code works and is as efficient as I was able to create at the time but from a personal view the front end design could use some work. This in particular was a good experience however as it taught me to separate my view of the code created for back-end development from the design. As I learn more about design and front-end programming this will change however this project was meant to showcase my ability to build a Ruby on Rails application and it does.

### Conclusion

As this project was my second coding creation I am again very proud of it. This project in particular turned out to be very instructive, more of a challenge and even more rewarding as this showed me that I can work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, utilize new gem’s and their API’s, mailers and even learn to work with HAML while creating a fully functioning web application.
