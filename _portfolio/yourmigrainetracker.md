short-description: Your Migraine Tracker, for migraine sufferers in the US.

---
This project was created keeping my family and myself in mind. We all suffer from migraines and have never found a satisfactory website or app to track them. Using this site users are able to login or sign up and keep track of their pain on a scale of 1 to 10, use different APIs to predict triggers such as Allergies or a barometric pressure changes, and be able to keep track of the medications they are currently on for their migraines. This app uses mainly Ruby on Rails.
