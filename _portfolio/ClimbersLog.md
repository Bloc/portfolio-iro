  Climber's Log is a workout log geared specifically towards rock climbers.  Oftentimes training schedules become disorganized and therefore less effective.  Climber's Log addresses the problem by allowing you to record your training sessions with a title ("Endurance, Power, etc."), a description, and the date it occurred on.  There are also embedded Youtube videos from some of my favorite professional climbers with training and nutritional advice.  Challenges I faced while working on this project include learning React.js and ES6 as well as integrating React with Ruby on Rails.  Thankfully the react-rails gem made it possible to do a simple integration (go gems!).  I had a lot of fun with my first project using React, and am excited to use it in the future.  One thing I would have done differently is the front-back end integration.  I would make a Rails API and a separate React front end.  I would also use react-bootstrap instead of twitter-bootstrap.  This was just a fun project to get started on React and Rails integration.  MyClimb does the same thing but better.  All in all this was a fun project and I'm stoked to learn more about React, Redux/Mobx, and React Native!
