short-description: BlocJams is a music player app.

For our first project in the Bloc Software Developer course, we created a music player to play songs from a collection of albums. BlocJams takes a collection of albums and allows the user to choose an album and play songs.

The purpose of this project was to allow students to become familiar with frontend development of an application. We worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to produce a functional music player.

The first phase of the project was focused on using HTML and CSS to create the landing, collection, and album pages of the player. We needed to understand how to set up the HTML structure and use CSS to add style.

Next, we implemented vanilla DOM scripting to add functionality to the player. This allowed the user to move between pages, choose an album, and play/pause a song.

In the final phase of the project, we refactored the player using jQuery. This was a great opportunity to learn how to use one of the most popular JavaScript libraries while simplifying the code.

The result was a fully functional music player built while developing frontend skills.  

Overall, this project taught me a lot about many important concepts required for frontend development. I learned about manipulating the DOM in vanilla JavaScript and with jQuery. I became more comfortable with event handlers and how to add functionality to the code. Most importantly, I this project taught me how to break down a project into functional tasks, then implement those tasks in code.
